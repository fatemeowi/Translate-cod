# Password Translator

This is a simple web project that allows you to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a sentence or word using a basic ASCII shift method. Each character in the input is shifted by 6 in its ASCII code to encrypt, and shifted back by 6 to decrypt.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
4. Use the form to select an operation:
   - **Create**: Encrypt your input text.
   - **Translate**: Decrypt previously encrypted text.  
5. Enter the text in the input field and click **Submit**.  
6. The result will be displayed below the form.

## Example

**Encrypting a sentence:**

Input: `hello world`  
Output: `Encrypted: nkrru$cuxrj`

**Decrypting a sentence:**

Input: `nkrru$cuxrj`  
Output: `Decrypted: hello world`
